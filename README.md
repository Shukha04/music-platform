# Getting Started with Online Music Platform App

This project created by courses found in internet to practice such skills as Typescript, NextJS and NestJS, how to use
interact with audio files on web-site etc. and is just a test version

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

```bash
cd client && npm run dev
# or
cd client && yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed
on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited
in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory treated
as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
